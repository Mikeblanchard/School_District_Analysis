# School District Analysis

## Overview

Our purpose of this analysis was to correct for innacurate data for the grade nines at Thomas High School, and to observe that impact on the rest of the collective data. We are paying close attention to how this affected:

- The math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by School spending
- Scores by School size 
- Scores by type of School

#### Summary

The biggest changes we saw were rate of overall passing, which removing the faulty data of grade nines clears up. A deceased number of students would represent a smaller data pool to pull from. Given that not much else changes in the categories we looked at, we can conclude that the effect was minimal.
