# School District Analysis

## Overview

Our purpose of this analysis was to correct for innacurate data for the grade nines at Thomas High School, and to observe that impact on the rest of the collective data. We are paying close attention to how this affected:

- The math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by School spending
- Scores by School size 
- Scores by type of School

## Results

We first looked at the raw data. In the table below, we see the original analysis, which included the math and reading scores for the grade nine students at Thomas High School. We see a few patterns that jump out, mmostly the achievement between Charter Schools and District Schools, with the former having higher scores in both Math and Reading. 

Also of note, is that the Per Student Budget is not an indicator of achievement in the Math and Reading scores we see. Perhaps an evaluation of teachers and their practices is needed to understand why certain schools did better.

This second table is with the grade nine students from Thomas High School removed. Very little change was obvserved across the categories we looked at.

## Summary

The biggest changes we saw were rate of overall passing, which removing the faulty data of grade nines clears up. A deceased number of students would represent a smaller data pool to pull from. Given that not much else changes in the categories we looked at, we can conclude that the effect was minimal.
